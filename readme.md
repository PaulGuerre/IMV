# Instagram Messages Visualizer

This project allows users to delve into their Instagram private messages, accessing the entire conversation history. It enables users to trace back to their first-ever messages and also explore the most recent ones. Additionally, the web application offers insightful statistics, such as message count and the date of the initial conversation. Users simply need to upload the Instagram-provided zip file and select the conversation they wish to explore.

You first need to zip the folder containing the "messages" folder. You'll upload this zip file then.
